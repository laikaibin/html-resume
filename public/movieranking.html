<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Spirited Away</h3> 
<p>Beautiful story of growing up. The directing, visuals, music, everything. Made me a Hayao Miyazaki fan.</p> 
<h3>2. Love Actually</h3>
<p>Heartwarming tales of Christmas spirit. What's not to love!</p>
<h3>3. John Wick</h3> 
<p>Man loves wife. Wife dies. Gives dog. Dog dies. Man goes cray cray. Hardcore nonstop new age action.</p>
